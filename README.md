# 2DQ9-LBM
2DQ9 Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) solver for a lid driven cavity flow

Requires:

    C++11
    Glut

Video demo: https://youtu.be/Q3rYTyEtlEk
    

2DLBM lets you choose between 4 already set up simulations or allows you to manually input the simulation parameters. It also allows you to choose the frequency in which the plot of the results is updated. Once the simulation starts, a new window appears showing its results at each nth step. 

Controls:

    'SPACE BAR': pause simulation. 
    '1': Hide / show velocity vectors. 
    '2': Change between colour scale 1 and 2. 
    '3': Change between velocity and cell type view. 
    'ESC': Exit program.
